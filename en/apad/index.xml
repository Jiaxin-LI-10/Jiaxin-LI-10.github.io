Cai, Zhifeng, and Jonathan Heathcote. 2022. &amp;ldquo;College Tuition and Income Inequality.&amp;rdquo; American Economic Review, 112 (1): 81-121. DOI: 10.1257/aer.20181027
Abstract This paper evaluates the role of rising income inequality in explaining observed growth in college tuition. We develop a competitive model of the college market, in which college quality depends on instructional expenditure and the average ability of admitted students. An innovative feature of our model is that it allows for a continuous distribution of college quality.</description></item></channel></rss>
